mov eax, [ebx+ecx*4]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at the address calculated by `ebx + ecx * 4`.  The bug arises when `ecx` is a very large number, causing an integer overflow in the calculation `ecx * 4`.  This leads to accessing memory outside the intended range, resulting in a segmentation fault or unpredictable behavior.
